   <h4><i>"Toy Pencil RPG man"</i> &nbsp; This was a model of a toy army RPG man, in which the rocket laucher was to be replaced with a pencil. This one was 3D printed, and could actually fit a #2 pencil.</h4>
   <h4><i>"Self Reflection"</i> &nbsp; This was a Personal self protrait, I made early on. I was working on trying to create the human form.</h4>
   <h4><i>"forEyes products"</i> &nbsp; These two were part of a project in which me and a group of people were meant to create a product an pitch it to the rest of the class, as if we were selling it.
